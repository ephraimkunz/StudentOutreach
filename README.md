# StudentOutreach
A tool for teachers to send personalized messages to students on Canvas.

## Issues with Canvas
* Canvas allows sending generic messages to groups of individuals. It would be nice to write a message with placeholders that are filled in with the student's name at the time they are sent, making the message feel more personalized.

## Installation
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/ephraimkunz/StudentOutreach/releases).
2. Under Assets for the latest release, click on `StudentOutreach.app.zip`. It will download to your Mac.
3. Click on the app icon in the Downloads folder. A scary warning will pop-up. Hit `OK`.
4. Go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> scroll down. You will see a section that mentions StudentOutreach.
5. Click on Open Anyway. Another scary warning will popup. Click `Open`.
6. You'll need to create a canvas access token and paste it into StudentOutreach. [Here are some instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-as-a-student/ta-p/273). StudentOutreach should remember the token you enter for future app launches.
7. You only need to do these steps once. Future launches of the app will work without any hassle.
